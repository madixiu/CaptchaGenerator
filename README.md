# Captcha Generator Sample App
This is a sample .NET Core console application that generates captcha images using the Captcha.Net library.

## Overview
This app demonstrates how to generate random captcha images using the Captcha.Net library in a .NET Core application.

### Some key points:

The app uses the CaptchaGenerator class from Captcha.Net to generate captcha images.

The complexity and size of the captchas can be configured by passing options to the captcha generator.

The generated captcha image is saved to the console output folder as a PNG file.

The correct text for the captcha is logged to the console.

## Usage
To run the app:

Clone the repository
Build the .NET Core console app
Run the executable
This will generate a sample captcha image in the output folder along with logging the correct text to the console.

The code shows how to integrate the captcha generation into a .NET Core app. This can be used as a starting point for adding captcha capabilities to web, desktop or other types of .NET apps.

## Captcha.Net Library
